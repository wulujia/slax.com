# Built an open-source tool to save content permanently and simplify learning

We’re a small team building Slax Reader, an open-source "read-it-later" app that does two things:

1. Saves web content permanently (even if the original disappears).
2. Helps you understand what you save with built-in AI tools.

Try it or contribute here: https://github.com/slax-lab

## What it does

- Save content: Works with web pages, X threads, and YouTube videos. PDF/newsletter support coming soon.
- Learn faster:
    - Highlight confusing terms → Get instant explanations without switching tabs.
    - Auto-generate summaries, mind maps, or outlines from long texts.
- Organize: auto-tagging, search by keyword or semantic meaning
- Subscribe: Follow creators’ public collections. For example, if Elon Musk uses Slax Reader and shares his bookmarks publicly, you can subscribe to his collection and explore what he’s been reading and watching.

## Why we built it

Part of the reason is that many internet links are disappearing. According to Pew Research, 25% of web pages from 2013 to 2023 are already gone. When links die, it feels like losing part of your memory. As someone who reads a lot, I want my saved content to stay accessible forever.

The second reason is that existing tools either just save content or require hopping between apps to learn. We wanted both in one place.

## Current status

- Self-hostable (https://github.com/slax-lab/slax-reader-api), but setup is currently complicated. We’re prioritizing one-click deployment for v2.
- Free to use (with paid options for heavy AI usage).

## We’d love your help!

- Feedback on features (do you find it useful? what’s missing?)
- Contributions to code, docs, etc.

No hype, just a tool we think some of you might find useful. Any feedback is appreciated!
