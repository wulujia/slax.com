# Built a free, open-source Pocket alternative that saves FULL articles (not just links) because of the shutdown

Pocket is shutting down, which sucks for saving full articles. We built a free, open-source tool-Slax Reader that imports your Pocket library and saves the full content (not just links!) with your tags transferred.

The articles render exactly like the original sites, so you keep that clean reading experience.

Here’s a quick peek at the interface:

I’ve thrown my own library of 3000+ articles at it, and the import process has been pretty smooth.

Since we're all kind of in the same boat with the Pocket news, we're offering unlimited storage for early users who want to import their Pocket stash or save new stuff. All free.

The whole thing is open-source (https://github.com/slax-lab), and we're working on Docker/Linux versions and other self-hosted options because I know how much many of us value having full control over our own data.

Beyond just being a read-it-later app, we've also been building in some AI tools – think auto-generated summaries/analyof articles, or asking an AI questions about what you're reading without leaving the page. These are also free to try out right now.

I'd genuinely love for you to try it out, especially if you're a Pocket refugee. 
 
Anyone else found good alternatives? Would love to hear what's working for you all.
